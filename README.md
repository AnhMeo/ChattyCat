# Overview
This is a project that pushed me to do a lot of research and learn how to put networking and programming
concepts I have learned into a real world application. The goal was to create a functional, user-friendly 
chat system that demonstrates core networking principles using Python.
To get this to work, follow these steps: 
1. Run the server FIRST: simply run the server in VSCode
2. Create a new terminal
3. use the CLI of the terminal to run the client: python .\ChattyCat_Client.py
4. The client will now be connected to the server. Repeat steps 2-3 to add additional clients. 
5. Use the client GUI windows to chat!

# Network Communication

In this chat application, I am using a client/server architecture that allows for several clients to connect. 

I am using TCP through SOCK_STREAM, and I chose to use port 9999 as it is unassigned, so it is available for use here.

The  messages are in the utf-8 format. 

# Development Environment

This program was developed in VSCode
Language: Python
The following libraries were used: 
Socket - for the networking 
Tkinter - for the GUI
Threading - for continued listening for messages and to allow multiple clients
Datetime - for the timestamps on messages

# Future Work


* Create a feature for the client that allows users to set their username
* Create a server feature that automatically assigns a color to the client names to easily differentiate who is talking
* Improve error handling and work on a reconnection feature
* Possible future feature: add support for cross-platform client connections (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
